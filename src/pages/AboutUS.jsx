                Liberia Rural Intervention for Education, Health, and
                Agriculture Development (RIEHAD-Liberia) Inc. is a
                non-for-profit organization established on November 20, 2018,
                and was accredited on February 19, 2019, by the government of
                Liberia. Lydia K Mallah is the founder of RIEHAD-Liberia. From
                2007 to 2009, during her tenure as the vice speaker for Nimba
                County Childrenâ€™s Parliament, now known as the Children Forum,
                Lydia began contemplating the reconstruction of Liberia. Her
                vision was to transform Liberia into a safe and healthy nation.
                Her dedication to serving her community intensified in 2014 when
                she contributed to life-saving efforts during the devastating
                'EBOLA' outbreak that ravaged three neighboring countries in
                West Africa: Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. This work was
                undertaken through the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). In 2018, as
                a senior student at African Bible College University in Yekepa,
                Nimba County, Lydia gained diverse perspectives on identifying
                and interpreting social issues. Driven by her passion for
                humanitarian aid and informed by her experiences, Lydia
                established the Liberia Rural Interventions for Education,
                Health & Agriculture Development (RIEHAD-Liberia) as a
                Non-Governmental Organization (NGO).
